Hello Crogglers!

We haven't written for the last few days, but that's only because there was so much exciting development being done!
We have released version 1.1 of Croggle, which is the first major update since the ending of the PSE project.
New in this release is the following:
* Exchanged most of the alligator and egg graphics with new ones, courtesy of Iris
* Added some gimp files to the repository for better ability to modify
* Added new effects to be used in animations: Shader based recoloring and rotations
* Drastic improvements to animations. Now you can see step-by-step what's going on
* Merging previously mentioned improvements, namely FroYo support on Android and revised operations on the model

We also created new releases with binaries on github for [android] and [desktop].
The android version is even signed!
Unfortunately, this can mean that you have to uninstall your previous installation before upgrading, since the signatures are different :(

The new version became ready just in time to participate in this year's [appartawards] by ZKM here in Karlsruhe.
The registration form did not respond, though, and so we hope that our submission via email will be accepted.
We will keep you up to date on any developments in that direction.

Exciting times lie ahead of us!
Thank you for reading :)
