Big news: As of today, we are having this little site to present our project!  
  
If we find the time, we may put up small articles here describing Croggle and answering questions which may arise.
We also intend to post some of the things that are evolving around it here soon.
Or in other words do some "blogging".
This is why we chose to base it on [Jekyll][jekyll], as well as due to the fact that it is highly recommended by GitHub.  

Let's see what the future brings :)
