After the magical disappearance of the first entry, we went ahead and just resubmitted our game to the libGdx game gallery.
The showcase is currently the only one featuring prebuilt binaries downloads, although we don't intend it to remain that way.
The text is pretty much stupid advertisement buzzwords concatenated, but it may be useful for some folks while we prepare this blog/website.

You can find the gallery entry [here][link]
