Hello again!

This is just a quick heads up for all of you (at present or in the future) who are interested in contributing to Croggle.
Since we hadn't even picked a license before, contributing could have been problematic for you.
Finally, this issue has been dealt with!

By adding a small copyright notice to the Readme.md of all important repositories, the terms under which our code can be used have become perfectly clear.
We decided to rely on the widespread Apache License  v2.0.
This is not only motivated by iq being a pretty liberal and standard license, but also because libGdx has been licensed under the same license.
That way, we did not have to think much about where to apply and attach which license and could simply put it at the one most prominent file in the repository.
Hopefully, we did not overlook any third party part of our software project, or we would have to the things which I just sketched.

Nevermind, be happy and fork us! We would be delighted to see anyone out there making contributons or forking Croggle to make it better.

See you soon!
