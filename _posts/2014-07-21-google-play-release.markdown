Hello folks!  

Yes, we know: long time, no read. And we are sorry for that.  
Since we are all heavily engaged in our studies there hasn't been much time recently to be spent on development - nor on this blog.
But there are still little signs of life, one of which we want to announce in this post:  

__Croggle is on Google Play store!__  

[The institute][ipd] that accompanied us throughout development, has dug up a developer account, and they were eager to put the latest release up there immediately.
So from today on, you will find it easiest to download and install your latest version of Croggle from [here][playlink] (which is currently [1.1.1]).
Don't be shy and jump right over there to try it out.
We would be happy to receive your feedback there, too. Also, feel free to share the app and your opinion on your social channels.
Maybe this can give us some motivation to continue development a little more actively, soon.  

And don't forget that Croggle is [__OPEN SOURCE__][licensepost]! We encourage everyone to contribute if he or she can.
Just visit our [GitHub] :)

This is all we want to tell you for today, but there sure is more!
We expect the second set of news to be publishable this week, so stay tuned.

So long, happy (Google-) playing!
