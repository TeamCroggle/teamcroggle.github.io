We just added/updated the release tags in our GitHub repositories for croggle-android and croggle-desktop.
This time, we included downloadable binaries, so from now on we have a decent binaries hosting.
Previously, they were stored in Lukas' dropbox :D  
If you are interested, head over to the [android][android] and [desktop][desktop] releases.
We would also appreciate your feedback, so feel free to post in our [issue tracker][issues]

Maybe we will add some new features if we find the time, to be able to show something on our KIT day of computer science talk.
So stay tuned!
