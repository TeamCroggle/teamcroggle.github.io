We have fantastic news!

If you followed this blog over the past couple of posts, you certainly have read that Croggle is the android adaption of an already existing game idea.
Its inventor is the world famous [Bret Victor][bret], who originally published his thoughts on his website already in mid 2007 (according to google).
Since we did not only copy his idea, but also his alligator images (at least during earlier development and sill in some places), we felt obligated to notify him.
We also used the opportunity to ask him for his permission for us publishing the app in the near future.  
Today, we finally received his answer!

He was pretty quick for someone who does so many great things - although he didn't really go into detail...
But read it yourself:

It is a really cool move of him, and we want to thank him here once again.
Now we will reconsider our publishing strategy for the near future, and who knows?
Maybe we will make Croggle an even bigger thing then!

That's it for today, though.
See you soon!
