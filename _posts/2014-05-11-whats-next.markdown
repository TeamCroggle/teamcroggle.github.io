Here's another update on the project status.

After releasing version 1.1, there is still so much to be done which could increase the quality of the game.
Unfortunately, probably none of us have enough time to spend on the project in the foreseeable future to realize all of the points.
In order to focus on what's most important, we will maintain this list to see which features really matter.
This is a quick writeup of all things which came to our mind so far:

Concerning code:

1. Block UI while still animating the last step
2. Less shader switches by drawing ColoredBoardObjects systematically in WorldPane
3. Add win and lose animations
4. Show the game finished screen when the last animation is done instead of after 2 seconds
5. Code review - always good, never done
6. Decrease overall loading times
7. Buffer screens where possible instead of recreating them every time
8. Do another port :P (iOS, GWT)
9. Add trivia messages in loading screen
10. Add a sandbox level
11. Add a lambda-only mode (parse lambda string and represent/simulate it witg alligators)
12. Animated tutorials
13. Exchange alligator graphics in achievement icons and avatars

Other stuff:

1. Publish the game on google play or similar
2. Introduce the game to a broader audience
3. Find more contributors
